# App Health DB

To provide a better solution towards the issue of hospital administration
and optimal appointment times, we provided an application to better predict
the future of a patient.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the idea of providing more accurate information about patients 
to hospitals and the development of precision medicine, we created this 
application as a form of aide towards hospitals and patients. We wanted 
to provide a way for doctors to have information and data about a specific 
patient. We also wanted to provide a way for analysis of individual patients 
to be made, to better decide medical treatment for a specific patient, and 
to base it on a patient's own analysis rather than an average. This is how 
we wanted to contribute towards precision medicine. Lastly, we desired to 
create a way for clients to easily set their own appointments easily with 
a simple website.

## What it does

The project consists of two things: a hospital-side application and a 
client-side application. The hospital-side application is a desktop 
applications to allows doctors to look up patient information, see 
patient details, and discover patient analysis based on their history. 
The client-side application is a website that allows patients to easily 
create appointments, pay fees, and check for available treatments.
